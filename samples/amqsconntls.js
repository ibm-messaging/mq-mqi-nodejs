/*
 * This is an example of a Node.js program to connect as a client to an
 * IBM MQ queue manager with a TLS-secured channel.
 *
 * The queue manager name and the CONNAME
 * are set to default values of "QM1" and "localhost(1414)" to demonstrate
 * how to use them but these can be overridden on the command line.
 *
 * The SVRCONN channel is assumed to have been defined with
 *    DEFINE CHL(SYSTEM.SSL.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) +
 *        SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL) +
 *        SSLCIPH(TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256)
 *
 * It is also assumed that you have a local keystore containing, at minimum,
 * the signing cert to validate the queue manager's certificate. This
 * keystore is in kdb format, and called "mykey" here. All the keystore
 * files should be in the current directory, not just the .kdb but also
 * the .rdb and .sth files.
 *
 * Other non-programmatic ways of connecting to the queue manager are
 * of course also possible, via the CCDT and controls set as environment
 * variables (eg MQSSLKEYR) or in the mqclient.ini file. These are
 * described in the MQ documentation - this node package follows the
 * C client libraries for connectivity.
